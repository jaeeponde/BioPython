# Computational Biology

Codes that use python modules to solve basic computational problems in biology. These include DNA sequencing, alignment, data processing and modelling.

1. Biopython :
   - Coursework from the Python for Life Sciences course offered on udemy.
   - Basics of manipulating strings as DNA sequences.
   - Application of biological principles of replication, transcription, recombination etc.
   - Accessing sequences of organisms from NCBI as fasta files and using them to run the string function. 
2. Genomic Data Science Specialisation :
   - Coursework from John Hopkins University
   - Each folder explores different computational biology problem ranging from alignment to modelling, every folder has it's own description file
