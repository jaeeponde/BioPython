Projects are taken from the Genomics Data Science Specialisation by John Hopkins University 
The string related codes are programs that use basic string manipulation to read and align DNA sequences using FASTA and FASTQ files from the NCBI database
The next set of codes use different data structures and algorithms to tackle the read alignment problem.
